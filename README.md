# Matrix-Ai-Agent
AI Agent coded in two different systems.

The First system is the major one, coded in JAVA.

Neo our AI Agent(Player) is founded in a NxN grid, with X number of hostages and Y number of agents(enemies)
Our goal is to save the most number of hostages without having to kill any enemies, there's recurring damage on the hotages where if it reaches the max, they turn to agents that Neo need to kill before finishing the game.
There are pads to teleport from a location in the grid to another, and health pills.

The starting and ending postion of Neo is the Telephone booth.



The 2nd implementation is coded in Prolog with less constraints, no enemies, pills or pads, and the grid size in constant.
